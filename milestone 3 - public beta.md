# Milestone 3 - Final Presentation (Public Beta)

We are happy to invite you to present your third milestone at **ECS 104**, April 1st 2pm-5pm
  
In this meeting, you'll have the opportunity to present the beta version of your project and share your experience with each other, the mentors as well as additional guests!

We remind you that for this third milestone you are required to provide a fully functioning project, that will be evaluated by the mentoring staff. You will get valuable feedback regarding the expected final project configuration and scope.  **By the third milestone you should have completed your product** (except for some minor bugs which you may fix until the [Final Submission](/final%20submission.md)). 

Please send us the presentation (and any other document that you think would be useful for us to better evaluate your work) by email beforehand. As we may have additional guests that did not attend your previous presentations, **make sure your presentation is self contained**.  

Please include in your presentation:

- Product overview and motivation: a pitch of no more than 90 seconds - aim this at a "new and general audience", see below for resources on how to prepare your pitch.
- Demo (from the perspective of your personas that show the main scenarios and features)
- Your insights of testing your product with real users

Some general advice:

- For the pitch refer to these guidelines: 
- Prepare an appealing demo! You only have a short time for the demonstration so start with your key features and give an overview of what the app is about for guests who will be there for the first time
- If you are demonstrating social features of your gadget, or any other features that require prior preparations - please prepare them in advance! (e.g. creating social networks of several users). 
- Please remember to keep your documents up to date on GitHub. 

**Important note:** Full grading for the milestone (25 points) will be given for teams that successfully:

1. Focused on the primary use case and take into account our feedback from milestone 2 or earlier.
2. Followed the project plan while adapting dynamically.
3. Continuously worked throughout the semester.
4. Demonstrated an interesting, self contained, useful, and live application.
5. Provided a link to a live application.
6. Implemented a set of polished features.
7. Gave a good presentation (simple, clear, focused, time-framed, sincere).
8. Kept documentation up to date
9. Summarized insights on user testing 

**Important note:** This is not the final submission of your project. Please see details on the [Final Submission](/final%20submission.md) page.

If you have any questions or comments please do not wait for the milestone meeting, please contact us on Slack.

Good luck!
