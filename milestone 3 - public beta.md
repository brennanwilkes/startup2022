# Milestone 3 - Final Presentation (Public Beta)

We are happy to invite you to present your third milestone at **ECS 660**, Friday 02/12/2016 at 1:30pm until 4:30pm.
  
In this meeting, you'll have the opportunity to present the beta version of your project and share your experience with each other (as well as additional guests).

We remind you that for this third milestone you are required to provide a fully functioning project, that will be evaluated by the mentoring staff. You will get valuable feedback regarding the expected final project configuration and scope.

>_“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.”_ - Steve Jobs

This is not BETA in the sense of "only a proof of concept" but rather in the sense of "you could still fix minor bugs or add minor missing features emerged at the last minute". **By the third milestone you should have completed your product** (except for some minor bugs which you may fix until the [Final Submission](final submission.md)). Please provide a full demonstration (**10 minutes**) of using your product in various scenarios on the *live* project. The demonstration should encompass your top features, and highlight your product complexity and challenges (architectural/algorithmic/technological/design/usability/etc). You should also talk about your development process (for an additional **5 minutes**).  Tell us: What was easy? what was difficult? why? what did you learn during the course? what feedback did you receive from users about your app?

If you plan to use slides, prepare **no more than 5** slides altogether (including cover slide). Please send us the presentation (and any other document that you think would be useful for us to better evaluate your work) by email beforehand. As we may have additional guests that did not attend your previous presentations, **make sure your presentation is self contained**.  You may also invite additional guests to the presentation.

Please include in your presentation:

- Product overview and motivation
- High level architecture, and the technologies used (briefly mention this)
- Project challenges, including your own experience and reflections
- Your insights of pilot testing your product with real users (please send us by email the pilot summary beforehand).

Some general advice:

- Prepare an appealing demo!
- You have only a short time for the demonstration so start with your key features and give an overview of what the app is about for guests who will be there for the first time (from our experience, getting to the live demo as early as possible helps clarify all the other parts).
- If you are demonstrating social features of your gadget, or any other features that require prior preparations - please prepare them in advance! (e.g. creating social networks of several users). 
- It is also advised to rehearse your presentation so it will flow nicely.
- Try to test out your laptop in ECS 660 in advance of your presentation. Also, make sure you have a backup for the live demo (i.e., video recording of your live demo).
- Consider creating a short promotional video to motivate the main use case of your app, with tools like [GoAnimate](https://goanimate.com/), Adobe After Effects, [PowToon](https://www.powtoon.com), etc...

For mobile applications you are required to provide a link to a page which includes images/videos which show how to install and use your application. In addition it should have a requirements section (i.e. if your app requires android 6.0). This page should be simple and clear.

**Important note:** Full grading for the milestone (25 points) will be given for teams that successfully:

1. Focused on the primary use case and take into account our feedback from milestone 2 or earlier.
2. Followed the project plan while adapting dynamically.
3. Continuously worked throughout the semester.
4. Demonstrated an interesting, self contained, useful, and live application.
5. Provided a link to a live application.
6. Implemented a set of polished features.
7. Gave a good presentation (simple, clear, focused, time-framed, sincere).

**Important note:** This is not the final submission of your project. Please see details on the [Final Submission](final submission.md) page.

Good luck,
